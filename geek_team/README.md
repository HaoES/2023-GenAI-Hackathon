Abstract:
Entrepreneurs in Morocco often struggle to find personalized advice for starting and managing businesses. To address this, we've developed a chatbot advisor using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. We've incorporated external data on doing business in Morocco to provide context-specific guidance.

Impact and Proposed Solution:
Our solution aims to empower aspiring entrepreneurs by offering relevant information on legal requirements, market trends, and financial considerations in Morocco. The chatbot serves as a tool to create a more informed and resilient business community in the country.

Project Outcomes and Deliverables:

RAG-Based Chatbot Model: Developed a user-friendly chatbot that understands and generates advice for entrepreneurs.

External Data Integration: Included data on Moroccan business environments to make the advice contextually relevant.

Localized Advice Generation: Enabled the chatbot to provide guidance tailored to the Moroccan entrepreneurial landscape.

User Interface: Designed an easy-to-use interface for seamless interaction with the chatbot.
