## Problem 

Morocco is facing a lack of economic diversification, with the country heavily reliant on a narrow range of traditional exports such as phosphates, fertilizers, and agricultural products. This limited diversification hinders the country's ability to generate sufficient economic value and creates vulnerabilities to external shocks, such as fluctuations in global commodity prices. As a result, Morocco struggles to achieve sustained economic growth and development, with its economy characterized by low levels of productivity and innovation.

The lack of economic diversification also contributes to Morocco's relatively low ranking in the Economic Complexity Index (ECI), which measures a country's ability to produce a diverse range of goods and services that are competitive in the global marketplace. With a ranking of 81st out of 133 countries in the ECI, Morocco lags behind many other developing countries, highlighting the urgent need for policy interventions aimed at promoting economic diversification and upgrading the country's industrial base. Failure to address this issue will likely result in missed opportunities for economic growth and development, as well as a failure to realize the country's aspirations for becoming a leading industrial nation.

## Impact / Proposed Solution 
Our project:
-Helps Morocco to broaden its export horizons. By harnessing the power of advanced analytics and predictive modeling, we aim to not only optimize existing portfolios but also unveil untapped opportunities that will position Morocco as a competitive force in the global market.​
- Augmente the ability to make informed, data-driven decisions in real-time about Products that bring the most value to Morocco.
- Position Morocco to thrive in the ever-evolving global economic landscape.

## Outcome / Results
- Elevate Morocco's Global Economic Standing from 81 to 60 in 5 years.
- Resilience Through Diversified Portfolios by entering new market and surviving in the competitive landscape​.
- Precision Export Diversification by personalizing our export, the right product to the right target at the right time.

## Recommendations
- This project can be better if we include a persona from the miniter of industry and trade to make it more personalized, as well as to have access to more data in an ethical way.
